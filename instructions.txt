setup an app as a twitter developer, you should have 5x keys: 2x consumer, a bearer token, and 2x auth keys.

from the bash console:

export TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN='' (add the bearer token with AAA between quotes)

mkdir nodesentiment
cd nodesentiment

 (enter all defaults)
npm install node-fetch

nano package.json (add "type": "module", after descriptions)
